2. Underneath that dropdown should be another option called **Tool Interface**.
3. Once selected, it will bring up another inspector panel with various options.
4. Drag and drop your folder(s) which contains all your sub-folders required to make a new `.modcomponent` file (e.g., `auto-mapped`, `blueprints`, `bundle`, `gear-spawns`, and `localizations`) to where it says 'Drag and Drop'.
5. There is also a button located at the bottom which allows you to set where those `.modcomponent`'s are generated.
6. After all those steps are done, select the 'Create .ModComponent(s)` and it will generate them to your selected path!
